### Tech Talk
1. I created 3 different js files: Phrase.js - Game.js - app.js
2. I created two classes: Phrase class and Game class
3. Inside the Phrase class: I created methods that have specific tasks to perform:

  ** addPhraseToDisplay(): this adds letter placeholders to the display when the game starts

  ** checkLetter(): checks to see if the letter selected by the player matches a letter in the phrase

  ** showMatchedLetter(): reveals the letter(s) on the board that matches the player's selection

4. Inside the Phrase class: I created methods that have specific tasks to perform:

  ** startGame(): hides the start screen 
  
  ** getRandomPhrase(): this method retrieves one of the phrases stored in array and returns it
  
  ** handleInteractions(): this method controls most of the game logic
  
  ** removeLife(): removes a life heart from the scoreboard
  
  ** checkForWin(): checks to see if the player wins the game
  
  ** gameover(): displays the start screen depending on the outcome of the game
